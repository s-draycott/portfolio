## Web Project Challenge

## Overview

-   Create a personal portfolio using one of the two designs on Figma as a template and deploy it using GitHub pages.
-   The designs are plain black and white, but you should choose a colour scheme and your own font pairings to use! (The pages to look at are "Template 1" and "Template 2" firstly to choose your style. Then look at "Template 1 examples" in order to see how different colour schemes / themes could work).

## Requirements

-   A deployed website (using GitHub Pages)
-   A public GitHub repository for your codebase
-   Use HTML & SCSS
-   Make good use of semantic HTML elements
-   Be responsive (mobile-first) and built with accessibility in mind
-   Code is highly readable (good naming and indented correctly)

## Extension

-   If you've got your website looking like one of those first two designs, there are 3 more "advanced" designs on the Figma you can take inspiration from to add to your portfolio
